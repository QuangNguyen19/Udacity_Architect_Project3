Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

1. IAM instance profile is not following the principle of least privilege, allowing full access to resources. 
2. Loadbalancer does not have HTTPS redirection
3. Security group of RecipeWebServiceInstance are too open
4. Server-side encryption and logging is not enabled for S3 buckets
5. RecipeWebServiceInstance are public to internet

Recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities

1. Edit IAM instance profile only provide  least privilege
2. Application Load Balancer sholud only use HTTPS protocol
3. Set Security group of RecipeWebServiceInstance only accpet inbound traffic from ALB Security group
4. Turn on S3 server-side encryption and logging
5. Put RecipeWebServiceInstance on private subnet.
