# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
Put web application instance on private subnet and make sure we can only SSH to this instance by AWS Systems Manager.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
No.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No, only new object after applying default encryption setting will be encrypted

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
Any manually configurated using AWS console  will be reseted.
