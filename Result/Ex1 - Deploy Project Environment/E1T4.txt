Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
InstanceRolePolicy-C3 permission is too powerfull (all action on all s3 bucket), we should provide least privilege. Because the client
only need to access recipes on free recipes bucket.

# Poor practice 2
We should put the "RecipeWebServiceInstance" on the private subnet and set up the security group of this instance 
only accept inbound traffic from security group of Application Load Blancer instead of openning too many port and protocol.
